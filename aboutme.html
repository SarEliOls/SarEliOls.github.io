    <p> My name is Sarah Olson, and I am a senior at Palm Desert High school. I hope to go to either Oregon State University or the University of Edinburgh in the fall, and i hope to become an architect. Architecture has been a dream of mine for a long time, because i love to create and design, and i consider myself to be a very hardworking, ambitious, dependable person.</p>
<p>Throughout my high school career, i have been involved in theater, sports, and organizations outside of my academics. I have played four varsity sports, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, and softball. Wrestling has been my favorite sport; I was the founding member of the first girls team in the history of the school, and went on to go 8-2, and win second in the entire league for my weight class, despite it only being my first year in the sport. I have also acted in three plays and have been involved in multiple theatrical competitions such as the Fullerton College Theatre Arts Department High School Theatre Festival and Poetry Out Loud, at which i placed second in Palm Desert High School. I am President of the Battle of the Books club this year, and have participated in clubs like Friends For Change. On top of that, I hold a volunteer job at my local zoo, The Living Desert, as a member of their Zooteen Program, and volunteer over 12 hours every month. I have been a volunteer since 2016, and have worked over 250 hours there. Balancing all of these activities, plus AP and honors classes, have been really difficult in the past, but I find that staying organized and trying to get ahead in classes when i can is the key to keeping your grades from slipping while managing other activities. For instance, if you know you have a project due a month from now, get it done right away when you have time instead of waiting until the last minute, because you never know how much work other teachers are going to be assigning.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed learning about me! Feel free to poke around my website and be sure to email me if you have any questions! Thank you! </p>
